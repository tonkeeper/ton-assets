  KUBA is a playful community-driven token built around the fun and mischievous spirit of Kuba AI — a Telegram mini-app bot designed to entertain, troll lightly, and brighten conversations. It serves as the native reward token within the Kuba ecosystem, used for missions, interactions, and community activities. In the future, KUBA will expand into more utilities including a swap platform similar to ston.fi, a token-creation toolkit, and potentially its own blockchain network. KUBA isn’t just a token — it’s the beginning of a growing, humorous, and experimental Web3 world.
