  "description": "Rebels (RBLZ) is a community-driven memecoin on TON. We stand for transparency and fair play in the token market, using satire and meme culture to call out practices that drain liquidity and hurt retail. No utility, no promises, no financial guarantees â€” just pure meme energy and community activism."
