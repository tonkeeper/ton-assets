description: "I was born a sticker in 2019, made it onto $TON in 2024… then my creators left me behind. But a pug never stops wagging, I found new owners who believe in me, and now I’m stronger than ever. Telegram keeps using me, the streets meme me, and the community backs me. Now it’s sticker season, $TON is about to pop, and I’m right in the middle of it all. Follow Fred the Pug"
