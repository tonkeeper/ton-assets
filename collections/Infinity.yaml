name: MOON Infinity
description: "
Infinity is one of the fastest and most powerful shuttles in the MOON App universe!
This is a real interstellar racer. It cuts through space at such a speed that the stars turn into light lines, and the planets only flicker along the way. Infinity's mission is to deliver you to the Moon in record time and help you collect as many $MOON tokens as possible."
